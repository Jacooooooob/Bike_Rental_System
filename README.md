# Bike Rental System

The Bike Rental System is a straightforward Java application designed to facilitate the process of renting and returning bikes for users.

- **Command-Line Interface (CLI):** Provides a simple command-line interface suitable for users accustomed to terminal usage.
- **Dynamic Inventory Management:** Real-time tracking of the current number of available bikes.
- **Cost Calculation:** Automatically calculates the rental cost based on the rental duration.
